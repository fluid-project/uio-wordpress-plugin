# User Interface Options for WordPress

This plugin adds the Infusion User Interface Options (UIO) component to WordPress websites.

UIO creates a sliding panel at the top of the page that contains controls which allow visitors to customize the presentation of a website to their own personal needs and preferences.

For more information, contact the [fluid-work mailing list](http://lists.idrc.ocadu.ca/mailman/listinfo/fluid-work) or join the [fluid-work IRC chat room](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/IRC+Channel).

Requires WordPress 4.1.1 or later. Tested with WordPress up to 4.1.1.

## Installation

1. Upload `user-interface-options.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unpack it.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the User Interface Options Settings page to specify where to insert the UIO panel and the table of contents.
4. Adjust the CSS of your theme to respond nicely to the changes that UIO makes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the development status of the UIO plugin?

This plugin is still in early development.

### How do I adjust the CSS of my theme to respond nicely to the changes that UIO makes?

See this [page](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/to-do/WorkingWithPrefsEditorOnSite.html) for tips on styling your site to work nicely with UIO.

### Are there any themes that already work well with UIO?

The plugin has been tested with several themes, and we found that the Miranda theme responds very nicely.

The default Twenty Seventeen theme also works fairly well, although some layout tweaks may be required for some preference combinations.
