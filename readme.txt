This plugin adds the Infusion User Interface Options component to the site.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the Infusion User Interface Options (UIO) component to the site. UIO creates a
sliding panel at the top of the page that contains controls which allow visitors to customize the
presentation of the site to their own personal needs and preferences.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

This plugin is still in early development.

See http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/to-do/WorkingWithPrefsEditorOnSite.html
for tips on styling your site to work nicely with UIO.

The plugin has been tested with several themes, and we found that the Miranda theme responds very nicely.
The default Twenty Seventeen theme also works fairly well, although some layout tweaks may be required for some preference combinations.
